      <p class="title">Welcome</p>
      <p class="abhay">This course is for students who don’t (yet) consider themselves computer persons. Designed for students who work with technology every day but don’t necessarily understand how it all works underneath the hood or how to solve problems when something goes wrong, this course fills in the gaps, empowering students to use and troubleshoot technology more effectively. Through lectures on hardware, the Internet, multimedia, security, programming, and web development as well as through readings on current events, this course equips students for today’s technology and prepares them for tomorrow’s as well.</p>

      <p class="title">How to Take this Course</p>
      <p class="abhay">Even if you are not a student at Harvard, you are welcome to “take” this course for free via this OpenCourseWare by working your way through the course’s six weeks of material. If you’d like to submit the course’s six assignments for feedback, be sure to create an edX account, if you haven’t already. Ask questions along the way via any of the course’s communities!

    If interested in a verified certificate from edX, enroll at cs50.edx.org/technology instead.
    If interested in transfer credit and accreditation from Harvard Extension School, register at web.dce.harvard.edu/extension/csci/e/1a instead.
